## What is git?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Git is a source control system that allows for historical snapshotting of files and sharing of those files amongst one or more people. Basically it's Google Drive with the ability to snapshot your file changes (but with so, so much more). This allows you to better keep track of changes in a filebase, give yourself access to your files from any machine with access to the internet, and the ability to implement new features to a repository without stepping on your fellow collaborator's toes. Also, Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, so there is your ethos appeal.

## Why use git?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It will make your life as a developer (or just user of files) easier. Sure you have to learn some stuff, but once you do, you will have the ability to control your codebase in a centralized, backed up, and efficent way. On top of that, knowledge of git increases your employability. Every real world developer position you will find will utilize some form of source control. If they don't, I would encourage you to seek opportunities elsewhere. Haven't convinced you yet? GIT IS FREE! and there are tons of free git hosting services. As you should be able to tell by now, I am rather fond of GitHub myself.

I learned how to make this readme [here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#links).
