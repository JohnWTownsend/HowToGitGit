### Aim to answer/accomplish these questions/tasks.
- [ ] What is git?
- [ ] Why use git?
- [ ] Let's make a repo
- [ ] Let's clone that repo
- [ ] Let's add some files and make a commit
- [ ] Let's show how I can pull those changes on another computer
- [ ] Let's do it another way by making a branch and commiting to that
- [ ] Let's merge that branch back to master
- [ ] Let's review
